# slimMenu jQuery Navigation Menu Plugin.
***

### slimMenu is a lightweight jQuery plugin, which is made to create responsive and multi-level navigation menus on the fly.

With slimMenu, you'll no longer struggle with media queries to create responsive menus, or any other heavy plugins to create multi-level nested menus. slimMenu does both job for you and it's only 5KB(2.5KB minified)!

## Features:

* Multi-level nested menus.
* 100% mobile responsive menus.
* Multiple slimMenu navigations on the same page.
* Tap areas to toggle sub menus easily in touch devices.
* Hover option and effects for desktop version.
* Submenu indentation options for responsive version.

## Browser Support:
(Tested on following browsers and confirmed that the slimMenu is working.)

* IE 9+
* Latest Chrome
* Latest Firefox
* Latest Safari
* Latest Opera
* Android 2.2+
* Mobile Safari

**Note About IE Support:** I don't have time to deal with lower versions of that ancient piece of work. You can fork the project and make it compatible with lower versions of IE if you want. I'll pull it if you send a request.

## Installation:
Add *slimmenu.css* to the head of your document:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="slimmenu.css" type="text/css">

Add *jquery.slimmenu.js* after jQuery plugin and before closing body tag.

    <script src="jquery.slimmenu.min.js"></script>

Create your navigation menu using an ordered list and add *slimmenu* class:

    <ul class="slimmenu">...</ul>

Initilalize the plugin:

    $('ul.slimmenu').slimmenu(
    {
        resizeWidth: '800', /* Navigation menu will be collapsed when document width is below this size or equal to it. */
        collapserTitle: 'Main Menu', /* Collapsed menu title. */
        animSpeed: 'medium', /* Speed of the submenu expand and collapse animation. */
        easingEffect: null, /* Easing effect that will be used when expanding and collapsing menu and submenus. */
        indentChildren: false, /* Indentation option for the responsive collapsed submenus. If set to true, all submenus will be indented with the value of the option below. */
        childrenIndenter: '&nbsp;', /* Responsive submenus will be indented with this character according to their level. */
        expand: '&#9660;', /* Content to show in the submenu expand button */
        collapse: '&#9650;' /* Content to show in the submenu collapse button */

    });

**Optional** Add easing plugin after jQuery plugin and before closing body tag if you want to use easing effects.

    <script src="**PATH_TO_PLUGIN**/jquery.easing.min.js"></script>
